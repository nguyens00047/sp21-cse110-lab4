## Part 1a
1. Line 9 prints out the phrase "values added:" and the summation of num1 and num2. If there 
2. Line 13 prings out the phrase "final result:" and the final result of the function.
3. Line 9 prints out "values added: 20".
4. Line 13 throws an error dbecause it cannot find a variable. It gives a "Uncaught ReferenceError" because result is not defined.
5. Line 9 throws an error because it tried to reassign a const variable.
6. An error is given because it previously tried to reassign a const variable.

## Part 1b
1. Line 12 prints out our index in the loop.
2. It prints out the discounted Price
3. The final price will be printed
4. This function will return the final prices of all the three numbers passed into the parameter, because of the function's nature.
5. An error is thrown because the "let" keyword scope does not allow some of the variables to be utilized inside of the function body.
6. An error occurs because discountedPrice can't be found because it was defined using let. The scope messes it up.
7. It prints out the final price.
8. This function will return the final prices of all the three numbers passed into the parameter, because of the function's nature.
9. An error occurs because i is not defined. The scope of i is bad because of the "let" keyword
10. It prints out the amount of items being discounted.
11. This function prints out the amount of items being discounted and the final price of each item.
12. 
A. student.name
B. student["Grad Year"]
C. student.greeting()
D. student["Favorite Teacher"].name;
E. student.courseLoad[0]

13.
A. "32", addition sign will just add 2 as a string to the 3
B. 1, subtracts so it sees 3 as a number instead of being a string 
C. 3, null is considered 0
D. 3null, '3' is seen as a string and + concatenates
E. 4, true is the numerical value of 1
F. 0, 0 + 0 is 0
G. "3undefined", sees 3 as a string and + concatenates 
H. NaN, undefined converts to NaN so then minusing it results NaN

14.
A. true, comparing two diff values, JS converts vals to numbers
B. false, 12 has more characters than 2, so it is false
C. true, 2 is equal to 2
D. false, they are not the same type
E. false, true becomes 1, not two
F. true, boolean(2) becomes true, so then they would be the same

15. The main difference between == and === is that you can compare variables by making type corrections but === doesn't allow that. If they are not the same type, it will return false.

17. modifyArray([1,2,3], doSomething) returns [2,4,6], the funciton will multiple each number by 2.
